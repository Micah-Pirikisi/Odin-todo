- Task completion tracking â€” check off tasks when done
- Smart Views:
  - Today â€“ view tasks due today
  - Upcoming â€“ view tasks due within a week
  - Important â€“ filter by high-priority
- "General" view to see all tasks from every project
- Edit and delete tasks and projects
- Persistent storage via localStorage
- Modals for viewing full task details & notes
- Caveat-font design with soft textures and dashed borders for a cozy, handwritten look

No build tools required â€” it's all pure HTML/CSS/JS.

- JavaScript (ES6) â€” core app logic
- HTML5 & CSS3 â€” layout and styling
